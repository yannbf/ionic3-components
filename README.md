_Currently this project is using the latest versions of all: Ionic and Angular 4_

This repository was made in order to help people learn and speed up their development process.
You will find many many different components, pages, pipes, services, of which can be very useful to you. Note though that these are all experimental!

The content here is a mix of tutorials found online, a few adapted codepen stuff, a few dribbble inspired layouts, and also other stuff made by the contributors of this project.

**HOPEFULLY** you will like this repo and feel like contributing, so please if you can, contribute so we can have even more amazing content!

## Demo
If you just want to check this project out, you can see the online demo at https://ioniccomponents.yannbraga.com/ or use [Ionic View](http://view.ionic.io/) with the code **bd1b6d71**.

Please notice that some plugins may **only work** when using a real device, so don't expect everything to work on ionic view or the browser.
